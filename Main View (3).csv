A major factor in the platform’s popularity is its sense of community. Each aspiring programmer has his or her own profile, and to motivate users to participate, the site offers feedback and badges for completing exercises, as well as a function that keeps track of a user’s total score and total day streak, and displays it to others.


The new brand identity establishes a uniform visual language that creates a sense of continuity across Codecademy’s wide range of training and activities. Open and adaptable, the identity is an umbrella that can be modified to represent different sections and sub-brands and expanded as Codecademy grows. The cohesive strategy enhances the usability of the platform and presents Codecademy as a mature, sophisticated organization on par with the major corporations, agencies and institutions it has entered into partnerships with, including the White House, YouTube, Twitter, New York University, NPR, SoundCloud, Gilt, and many others.

But the two-wheeled revolution, according to the organization, won’t come on the saddle of a race bike or a specialty bike — and that’s the challenge.

But in many cases, they only make you sicker. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 2 million Americans contract Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI), resulting in 100,000 deaths and over $30 billion in costs to the health care system per year. Experts agree: simply improving staff hand-washing habits could prevent these needless infections.Enter SwipeSense, Inc., the healthcare startup founded in 2012 by Mert Iseri and Yuri Malina, two Northwestern University graduates. SwipeSense aims to incentivize good hand-hygiene via smart, wearable, alcohol-based gel dispensers and a web-based monitoring platform. Resembling an Apple computer mouse, the SwipeSense device clips easily onto hospital scrubs, recording every time users disinfect their hands. Together with wall-mounted proximity sensors, the system wirelessly tracks hand-washing practices, allowing doctors and nurses to see and download daily, weekly, or monthly reports, much like a FitBit, Nike Fuel Band, or other popular Quantified Self products.Early results are encouraging: a 12-week trial at Northwestern Memorial Hospital showed a 64% increase in hand-sanitizer use. SwipeSense systems are currently undergoing trials in 10 U.S. hospitals and the startup has received numerous accolades, including being chosen as one of three finalists for 2013 Wall Street Journal Startup of the Year. Coming Clean About Bad Hand-Washing Habits
A recent New York Times article reported hospital personnel wash their hands only about 30 percent of the time they’re supposed to. Hospitals already have plenty of communal sinks and hand-sanitizing dispensers, but time-strapped care givers simply don’t use them and monitoring is still done manually with pen and paper. To figure out why compliance is so low, Iseri and Malina spent weeks observing staff at North Shore University Health System. They noticed a natural, prevalent behavior: medical staff wiped their hands on their scrubs. This insight lead to a personal, nonintrusive, and convenient hand-sanitizing solution that doesn’t interrupt the flow of care.IDEO encouraged us to incorporate the user’s perspective into every decision we make as a company, and every product we ship as engineers. This philosophy has lead us to delighted customers, a more effective technology, and most importantly, a stronger business.—Yuri MalinaA Hands-On Design Collaboration 
IDEO met SwipeSense at Healthbox, a Chicago digital-health accelerator program where the startup was in residence. Iseri and Malina had developed a working prototype of the hand-sanitizing device and needed help pushing it to the next level. For several months, IDEO designers held brainstorms with the two on alternative product architectures and manufacturing approaches, held hands-on prototyping charrettes, and helped them evolve and refine the final physical and digital experience of their product in CAD. The IDEO team also examined how an expanded data offering could provide added value to their business and the healthcare system at large. 
Working with IDEO was like having a cheat code in a video game. It rapidly accelerated our progress in terms of product development, bringing us much closer to a device and a web app that healthcare workers love.—Mert IseriA Simple, Life-Saving Solution
After more than 70 design iterations, SwipeSense landed on the current sleek, modern, user-friendly design. The eventual goal: make the patent-pending system ubiquitous in America’s 5,700 hospitals, much like wall-mounted hand-sanitizing devices are today—and save 100,000 lives lost each year.Let’s put our hands together for smarter, healthier hand washing.",

Patients of HGH therapy range from as young as age seven into adulthood. The treatment, which involves a challenging regimen of drug reconstitution and daily injections, becomes an integral part of a family’s life, often for years.Children with medical growth issues walk an emotional line between the negative stigma of being different from their peers and the positive celebration of growth. Lilly, which had marketed a delivery device for years, sought to make the injection process more kid-friendly. The company asked IDEO to design a new device specifically for children that would improve their acceptance of the therapy.The design team began with the assumption that kids might prefer a “toy-like” approach. However, after spending time in the field with various young users, research yielded telling new insights about pediatric adherence to treatment and redirected the project in a far more sophisticated direction. This underscored the importance of using in-context, user-based observations to inspire and guide design, as opposed to the guesswork that occurs in many board rooms and design studios. In addition to the field research, the design of IDEO’s delivery device was partially informed by that of the client’s existing drug-reconstitution device. This ultimately helped to create a more integrated, systematic approach to the treatment process.",
